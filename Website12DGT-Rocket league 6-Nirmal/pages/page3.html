          Rocket League is a game like no other and its competitive system is also not quite like other games. There are numerous modes to keep in mind but once you learn about the ranking system it’s easy to catch on.

          Rocket League has three playlists within Competitive mode: 3v3 Standard, 2v2 Doubles, and 1v1 Duel. These are the core modes that you’ll often see in esports tournaments and online competitions.

        <p class="para1 para2" tabindex="0">
          You will have a separate rank for each game mode. You’ll need to play 10 placement matches within each playlist — a total of 30 games — to get your rank for each mode. These placement games will determine your designated ranks for each mode, revealing your play level and finding other similarly skilled players to compete with and against.
