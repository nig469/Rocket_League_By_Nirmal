          Rocket League is a blast, and you should have some friends around for some snacks and a nice Rocket League split-screen co-op game. Seriously, it's amazing. As you know, Rocket League is the perfect game to play with friends, so let's dive into this important topic. How do I play Rocket League with a friend on a different platform? Players on Epic Games Store, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Steam can randomly matchmake with or against each other in all Online Match types. Cross-play is enabled by default.

          Rocket league can be played on PC and Mac for free click on the image on the side or up, to the download official download page!Can Rocket League be played on Mac?
          Despite not officially supporting macOS anymore, Rocket League can be played on Mac thanks to third-party such as CrossOver or through Bootcamp if you still use an Intel Mac. The best method we'd recommend to run Rocket League on Mac is CrossOver 22.
